# Iran Women Life Freedom Protests


## Overview

Gender inequality and discrimination against women have been legally established in Iran for many decades. After the tragedy of the death of Mahsa Amini,
the revolution movement was shaped by the Zan, Zendegi, Azadi (Women, Life,
Freedom) slogan. It shows that people and government are not one, and people can
not take any further injustice from the brutal regime. This movement wasn’t just
about women’s hijab; it was about people’s daily life difficulties after the Islamic
regime came into power.
